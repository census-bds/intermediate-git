# Intermediate Git

# Expectations for this talk

I assume some familiarity with basic Git operations.

But PLEASE stop me if I say something that doesn't make sense.

# How Git Works

Files are *commited*, *modified*, or *staged*

Stored in the Git directory, working directory, or staging area respectively

# How Git Works

What is a commit?

* Snapshot of the state of your repo

* **Not** a diff (unlike in Subversion)

---

# How Git Works

Tiny bit of internals (each of these has a SHA1):

* *blob*: a version of a file

* *tree*: a collection of pointers to blobs

* *commit*: pointer to a tree, plus commit metadata

---

# How Git Works

Commits include pointers to parent commits.

---

# Branches

What's a *branch*? Simply a pointer to a commit!

Don't believe me? Check!

    .bash
    > cat .git/refs/heads/master
    d12a3c549eb486c5ad5f95c145df4685097755ad
    > git show d12a3c54
    commit d12a3c549eb486c5ad5f95c145df4685097755ad

# Branches

    .bash
    git branch testing # create a new branch

.center[![New Branch](new-branch.png)]

    .bash
    > cat .git/refs/heads/testing
    8e19ecbd2b962a7eb4a2aa36b5bac51442a1b2a8
    > git show 8e19ecb
    commit 8e19ecbd2b962a7eb4a2aa36b5bac51442a1b2a8

# Branches

How does Git know what branch I'm on?

    .bash
    > cat .git/HEAD
    ref: refs/heads/master

.center[![HEAD](branch-head.png)]

---

# Branches

What happens when I commit?

    .bash
    > git checkout testing
    # edit edit
    > git commit

.center[![Advancing HEAD](commit-head.png)]

If we were to merge `testing` into `master` right now, it'd be simple (fast-forward).

---

# Branches

Let's make things more interesting:

    .bash
    git checkout master
    # edit edit
    git commit

.center[![Divergent History](divergent-history.png)]

---

# Merging

    .bash
    git merge testing

Git will:

1. Find common ancestor
2. Identify commit to merge into and commit to merge in
3. Create a new commit based on three-way merging. This commit has two parents.

If this is successful, it is safe to delete the branch.

    git branch -d testing
